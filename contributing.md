## Contributing

#### Make changes locally

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

#### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them. Don't forget to self-review to speed up the review process

#### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as PR.

- Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge. One you submit your PR, it'll be reviewed.

- You may be asked for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can make your changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
